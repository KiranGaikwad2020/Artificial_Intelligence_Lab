Lab 1: Introduction to ChatGPT

Objective:
The goal of this lab was to understand the fundamentals of ChatGPT, including its origin, underlying technology, capabilities, and applications across different fields.

Summary:
ChatGPT is an advanced conversational AI developed by OpenAI based on the transformer architecture, a deep learning model introduced in 2017. It is designed to generate human-like text by predicting the next word in a sequence, enabling it to understand context, respond to queries, and engage in meaningful conversations.

Working Principle:
At its core, ChatGPT uses a transformer model, which leverages mechanisms called attention to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence. This architecture allows it to capture complex language patterns and dependencies. During training, ChatGPT was fed vast amounts of text data from the internet, learning grammar, facts, reasoning abilities, and some level of world knowledge. When a user inputs a prompt, the model generates coherent and contextually relevant responses by probabilistically selecting words based on learned patterns.

Real-World Applications:

    Education: ChatGPT assists students with explanations, tutoring, language learning, and generating study materials.

    Healthcare: It helps in patient education, symptom checking, and supporting medical professionals with information retrieval.

    Business: Companies use ChatGPT for customer support, automating responses, content creation, and brainstorming ideas.

    Creativity: Writers and artists use ChatGPT for drafting stories, generating creative prompts, and enhancing productivity in creative tasks.

This lab helped explore ChatGPT’s interface, understand the transformer model’s structure through visual tools, and recognize the broad spectrum of practical use cases.
